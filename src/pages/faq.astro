            <p>Your first visit includes a comprehensive consultation, examination, and discussion of your health history. We take time to understand your concerns, explain what's happening in your body, and discuss treatment options. Expect to spend about 45-60 minutes with us.

            <p>Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows for movement. Athletic wear is ideal, but anything you can move comfortably in works fine. For women, it's helpful to wear or bring a sports bra for your initial examination.</p>

            <p>Please bring your insurance card (if using insurance), a photo ID, and any relevant medical records or imaging (X-rays, MRIs) if you have them.

            <p>In most cases, yes.

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Yes, chiropractic care is very safe when performed by a licensed professional. Dr. Beyerl uses gentle techniques and adjusts his approach based on each patient's comfort level, age, and health needs. We offer both traditional and low-force adjustment options, so even patients who are nervous about "cracking" can receive effective care.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Most patients find chiropractic treatment comfortable or even relaxing. You may feel some pressure during adjustments, but it shouldn't be painful. If you're sensitive or nervous, we use gentler techniques. Some patients experience mild soreness after their first few visits, similar to what you might feel after starting a new exercise routine—this typically resolves within 24-48 hours.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>This varies significantly based on your condition, goals, and how your body responds. Some patients feel significant relief after just a few visits, while others benefit from ongoing wellness care. We'll discuss a recommended treatment plan during your first visit, but we don't believe in creating unnecessary dependency. Our goal is to give you the tools to manage your own health long-term.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Neuro rehabilitation (also called brain rehabilitation) focuses on improving the connection between your brain and body. It's particularly effective for balance issues, coordination problems, and fall prevention. Using specific exercises and techniques, we help retrain your nervous system to improve stability, reaction time, and overall motor function.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Our neuro rehabilitation program is especially beneficial for adults 55 and older who want to maintain independence and reduce fall risk. It's also helpful for anyone experiencing balance issues, dizziness, coordination problems, or concerns about stability. Falls are a leading cause of injury in older adults—our program helps you stay confident and active.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Falls often result from a combination of factors: decreased balance, slower reaction times, reduced strength, and poor coordination. Our program addresses all of these through targeted exercises that challenge your vestibular system (inner ear balance), improve proprioception (body awareness), strengthen key muscle groups, and enhance your brain's ability to process movement information quickly.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>The length of neuro rehabilitation varies based on your starting point and goals. Many patients notice improvements in balance and confidence within 4-6 weeks of consistent training. However, like any fitness program, ongoing practice maintains and continues to improve your results. We'll create a personalized program that fits your schedule and needs.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Absolutely not. It's never too late to improve your balance and reduce future fall risk. In fact, if you've experienced a fall, that's an important signal that intervention can help. Our program can help rebuild confidence, improve stability, and prevent future falls. We'll start at your current ability level and progress gradually.</p>

            <p>Yes, vestibular rehabilitation—a component of our neuro rehabilitation program—can be very effective for certain types of dizziness, particularly those related to inner ear balance issues or vestibular dysfunction.
